# Project Title

Standard Diffusion Model with Cosine Schedule

## Description

This project is an implementation of a diffusion model for denoising images using a cosine schedule for the beta parameter. The diffusion model is a generative model that gradually adds noise to an image over time, resulting in a denoised version of the original image. The beta parameter determines the amount of noise that is added at each time step, and a linear or cosine schedule can be used to vary this parameter over time.
