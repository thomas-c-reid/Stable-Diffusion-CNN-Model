## Usage

To use this diffusion model with cosine schedule, you can run the `diffusion_cosine.py` script with the desired image and parameters. The script will load the image and apply the diffusion model with the specified schedule to generate a denoised version of the image. You can customize the schedule by adjusting the `cosine_beta_schedule` function in the script, which generates the beta values for each time step.
